# Machine Learning Tools-on-Iris-Dataset
This tool is made to perform Machine Learning classification on Iris Dataset.
In recent times, we have seen the vast use of Machine Learning tenchiques in the field of Datamining and Data analysis. The following tools are simple yet efficient.
Machine Learning classification tools are as follows: 

_**Support Vector Machine**_,

_**Logistic Regression**_,

_**Adaboost**_,

_**Random forest**_.
